## 🧠 How It Works

- **On Hover:** Image containers use Tailwind’s `group-hover:opacity` and transition utilities to reveal overlay buttons.
- **Animations:** GSAP’s ScrollTrigger animates the opacity/y-position of each section for dynamic entry effects.
- **Styling:** Built with Tailwind CSS—using custom utility classes layered into `index.css`.
